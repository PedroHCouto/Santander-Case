## About The Project

The Santander group is a global banking group, led by Banco Santander S.A., the largest bank in the euro area. It has its origin in Santander, Cantabria, Spain.

The program consists of a mix of training and competition, where Santander University provides content and selects the best participants.


### Competition
The program has 3 evaluation phases, which are:

* []()Phase 1: the candidates must take the Cultural Fit, General Knowledge and Logic Reasoning assessments. In this phase, there were about 3200 candidates and only 100 were selected.

* []()Phase 2: the candidates have 33 days to study all material selected by Santander Academy. In the end, there was a technical assessment and it is needed a performance over 50% to get certified.

* []() Probability and Statistics: from basics to advanced concepts;
* []() SQL and NoSQL;
* []() Big Data concepts and applications;
* []() Programming;
* []() Regression: Linear, Multiple, Ridge & Lasso, Variable Selection
* []() Classification: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest and Naive Bayes;
* []() Clustering: K-means, Hierarchical Clustering (divisive and agglomerative), Latent Dirichlet Allocation;
* []() Performance Metrics.
